# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project begins the utilization of working with databases, setting up security and testing, and deploying web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Overview and Objectives of the Project

During this stage of the project, we will

- set up an Express project
- create a database and connect it to the server using MongoDB
- configure the first routes and controllers
- handle errors

## Running the Project

To run the project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Node.js website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal to get started:

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
